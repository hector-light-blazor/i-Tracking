This application is for Hidalgo County. 
My current role is Application Developer III.
Hidalgo County needed a system to track vehicles, heavy equipment, and properties to determine if they had insurance or not. This web application will replace the existing workflow.

The current workflow is to fill out some excel forms and e-mailË™them to the executive office.

This has caused delays and uncertainties if vehicles, heavy equipment, and properties have the proper insurance coverage.

This application will mitigate and have the ability to track from beginning to finish.
